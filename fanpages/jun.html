  	<img src="jun/vday.png" width="350px" style="float: right;">
  	<p>Jun Suzaki is the lead guitarist of Fantome Iris, a fictional and technically real world band from the argonavis project. He was featured in the mobile game, AASIDE which ran for a year from 2021 before ending service in 2022. Read more about the project on the <a href="https://argobdp.miraheze.org/wiki/from_ARGONAVIS_Wiki">argobdp miraheze</a>!</p>
    <p>Jun is an incredibly unlucky man. On top of being generally frail, he's constantly running into trouble-- a trip to the store for Jun would include missing the bus, tripping onto wet paint while subsequently walking there, getting hit in the face by a ball thrown by some kids across the road and then finding out the last of the item he wanted to buy sold out just ten minutes before he arrived, on a good day. Despite this, he tends to look on the good side of things (i.e., "I lost my wallet... but it only had a dollar in it!") <span style="font-family: emojifont">D</span></p>
    <p>To put it simply, he's a NEET. He earns money through gaming tournaments, and occasionally helps out Daimon (Faniris's drummer, who runs a cafe on the first floor of the sharehouse they all stay in currently in the story) although that only covers the funds of his pet hedgehog, Johnny's, expenses.</p>
    <img src="jun/distress2.png" width="350px" style="float: left;">
    <p>He's the composer for Fantome Iris, with Felix (Faniris's vocals, and director of the band's aesthetics and story) often asking him of complicated requests because he has full faith in him.</p>
    <p>On stage and for the band, Jun takes on the persona "ZACK"-- a foul mouthed, and highly energetic character. Once he starts getting into character, he has trouble stopping and often spews long lines of profanities without a filter.</p>
    <img src="jun/jun-suzaki-zack.gif" width="286px" style="float: right;">
    <p>You can find a short introduction video to him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKxWRuNIrXs">here</a>!</p>
    <div class="divider1"></div>
    <p>wow!!! i am SO fond of this guy. he's such a fun character to me, i just adore his design and his personality soooo much. he was the type of character i saw and loved immediately because of design... i was so excited for aaside to release just because i wanted to know more about him!!!! aaside was such a fun game... great music, great characters, great art and REALLY good 3dmvs in my personal opinion. i know they didn't have the hugest budget ever, but i feel like they really captured the energy of a band performing live and i liked it a lot! <span style="font-family: emojifont">s</span></p>
    <p>by the way, did you know argopro is coming out with a new mobile game this year (2023 as of writing this)? it's called kimisute and i am praying so hard that they find a way to bring back the 3dmvs even though they've confirmed it won't be a rhythm game... i miss aaside :( it was so charming...</p>
    <img src="jun/pfp.png" style="float: left;">
    <p>anyways, enough rambling about aaside, i just think jun is so cool. he's really polite, but he's also sooooooooooo pretty in his stage costumes. i feel like he was a bit of a comedic relief character most of the time in the aaside story content, but he's just so sweet that i can't help but adore him T__T. also, he has a pet hedgehog named johnny who has the same red highlights in his hair (fur? quills?) as jun... it's so charming!!! <span style="font-family: emojifont">i</span></p>
    <p>he's a character that i want to draw a lot more because his design appeals so much to me in particular and i feel a want to give him the 'drawing a character so much they basically become your oc' treatment (just like jyushi lol) but my god is he so hard to draw...</p>
    <p>i think he has a really cute face, and i hope we get to see more illustrations of his face peeking out from his bangs when the new game comes out... that would be really cute. maybe i should add a little card collection section here when it comes out! <span style="font-family: emojifont">C</span></p>
    <img src="jun/sanrio.png" style="float: right;">
    <p>i'm not really good at describing why i like things, i'm sorry T__T. but just know i'm so so fond of him!! i've started making his cosplay because i want to wear it for the anime convention in my city this year ... i'm soooo so excited for ittttt sobs... i'll probably put together a small ita bag for it too because i ordered a few badges and other merch secondhand huhuhuhu. thank you so much if you read through this silly ramble!!! have the cinnamoroll sillies as a treat :D <span style="font-family: emojifont">s</span></p>

    <img src="jun/kimisute.png" style="float: left; width: calc(100% - 20px);">
    <p>KIMISUTE VISUALS RELEASED!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>
      everyone looks so good... i especially love haru's design!!! i think zack's is very very cool but i'm not a huge fan of the fur sorry king <span style="font-family: emojifont">l</span> i did doodle him though c:<br>
      <img src="jun/kimisute-art.png" style="width: 300px; float: right;">
      gawrsh... i am so so excited T__T everything about the new game sounds so good!!! i especially love the concept of getting to hear demos of songs as you work with your band of choice... i think there was something very charming about aaside's heavy contrast art style but the kimisute art has been so gorgeous so far i am auuuargghhuhhh i want to see everyone's initials... also they time skipped!!!! everyone is a year older now!!! that's so cool!!! i updated his info on the side huhu i really like that fromargo's characters are mostly adults, its such a nice change of pace (and why i love hypmic so much too)...<br>
      small aside but everyone's fits from faniris in wonderland were so cute... big fan of cheshire cat zack thats so silly lol<br>
      well... until next time...!!! (probably when kimisute or more info releases!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)</p>
